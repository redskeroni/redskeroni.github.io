            <p>Integration of AI into educational workplace settings, particularly for the benefit of neurodivergent individuals presents in itself a paradox. AI technologies like InnerVoice offer groundbreaking results in making learning more accessible, with real time object and concept identification; it is profoundly impacting the educational experiences of neurodivergent students. This level of accessibility offers independence to these said students, allowing a gap to be bridged between neurodivergent students and neurotypical ones, which in turn promotes an inclusive environment.</p>
            <p>However, the reliance on AI raises ethical considerations, particularly around the potential for embedding and perpetuating biases. AI systems are as unbiased as the data they are trained on, and the intentions behind their creation. Careful consideration and continuous evaluation of these AIs are necessary and risk reinforcing the inequalities which they aim to overcome. Thus, bringing to light the necessity of balancing AI for its support for neurodivergent individuals, while also being vigilant about the ethical implications of its application.</p>
            <p>There is a necessity for a system wide approach to promote inclusivity with a holistic strategy beyond just technological solutions. Technology, such as AI, should only be a tool employed with a larger framework. This framework should prioritize a universal design within education, an environment that is accessible to all students, without the need for special adaptation. There is an imperative to implement comprehensive strategies that consider the needs of neurodivergent students which reduces dependency on specific accommodations. Thus, allows more normalization of inclusivity with neurodivergent students.</p>
            <p>Additionally, we need to emphasize the importance of societal and structural changes beyond technological fixes. It is not an issue of how to “fix” learning in neurodivergent students, rather a fix in the societal norms we have grown accustomed to. Rethinking how educational content is delivered, educators training, and institutionalized structures, allows for more accommodational learning needs. Not only does it make education more accessible to neurodivergent students, but also enhances the learning environment for all students. </p>
            <p>In conclusion, while AI is an opportunity which represents support for neurodivergent learners, it is not a panacea. The ethical considerations among bias, dependence, and inclusivity must be addressed in combination with the technology presented for actual systemic changes. A holistic system wide approach that includes AI can create a more inclusive environment and moreover an equitable society. This way we can approach the unique combinations of neurodivergent individuals, leveraging their talents and perspectives via the usage of technology but also in all aspects of society.</p>
