      The profound terror inherent in the narrative of Omelas stems directly from the Narrator's endeavor to convince the reader that the existence of Omelas is irrevocably tied to the acceptance of a necessary evil. There is a clear and deliberate effort on the Narrator’s behalf to convince the reader that Omelas' utopian existence necessitates endorsing a vile injustice. Initially, the Narrator paints Omelas as an idyllic haven, likening it to "a city in a fairy tale." Further on in the passage, the Narrator admits that they are describing Omelas to suit the readers' likeness, stating, “Perhaps it would be best if you imagined it as your own fancy bids, assuming it will rise to the occasion, for certainly I cannot suit you all.” The interactive turn further draws the reader in, and it prefaces the moral dilemma to come.

      The narrative's horror deepens with how Omelas’ youth are introduced to the city’s dark secret at an impressionable age. It is implied that the youth are subjected to indoctrination at this age due to them “...seeming capable of understanding.” Yet, this assertion is contradicted by the children’s reactions; many leave the sight of the child in tears or silent fury, suggesting they are indeed too young to grasp the implications of their society's pact fully. The apparent contradiction highlights the most disturbing aspect of Omelas’ culture, being that of burdening its youth with the weight of their utopia’s foundational atrocity.

      Finally, the Narrator is incapable of describing what goes on outside of Omelas. The brevity of the two paragraphs describing the story's namesake speaks to this fact as a whole. This is the actual reason why the citizens of Omelas are forced to stay: the fear of the unknown. The Narrator states that the ones who walk away “walk ahead into the darkness, and they do not come back.” The fear the youth in Omelas are subjected to by seeing the child is directly contrasted by the fear they would experience from leaving Omelas. There is a false sense of security that Omelas brings to each citizen; the necessity of the inherent evil upholding Omelas is an axiom ingrained within them.
